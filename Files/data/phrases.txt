Believe in yourself and all that you are. Know that there is something inside you that is greater than any obstacle.
The only way to achieve the impossible is to believe it is possible.
Donâ€™t watch the clock; do what it does. Keep going.
The future belongs to those who believe in the beauty of their dreams.
The only limit to our realization of tomorrow will be our doubts of today.
